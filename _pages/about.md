This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

About Biochar
======
BioChar is a type of charcoal used in agriculture. It has the potential to revolutionise farming and combat climate change.

Our Mission
======
We believe in the potential of BioChar to transform agriculture and reduce carbon emissions. Our mission is to educate and provide resources for farmers, gardeners, and consumers about the benefits and uses of BioChar.

What is Biochar?
======
BioChar is a carbon-rich product that is created when biomass (such as wood, manure, or crop residues) is heated in a closed container with little or no available oxygen. In more technical terms, biochar is produced by thermal decomposition of organic material under limited supply of oxygen (O2), and at relatively low temperatures (<700Â°C).

This process, called pyrolysis, is different from the (typically high-temperature) burning and decomposition of organic material aboveground or in soils with plenty of oxygen (O2) present.

We support sustainable practices
======
By trapping carbon in the soil and thus preventing it from returning to the atmosphere, biochar can potentially play a significant role in mitigating anthropogenic climate change. Additionally, biochar improves the soil structure and provides habitat for many beneficial soil microbes.

We'd love to hear from you. If you're interested in learning more about BioChar or have any questions, please [contact us](mailto:youremail@domain.com).
