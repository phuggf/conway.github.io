Kaptured Carbon is at the forefront of carbon capture technology, turning greenhouse gases into assets. With a strong focus on biochar and carbon credits, we strive to enhance sustainability while promoting a circular carbon economy. Our innovative solutions aim to decrease atmospheric carbon levels and promote healthy soil ecosystems, leading us towards a greener and more sustainable future.

About Biochar
======
BioChar is a type of charcoal used in agriculture. It has the potential to revolutionise farming and combat climate change.

Our Mission
======
We believe in the potential of BioChar to transform agriculture and reduce carbon emissions. Our mission is to educate and provide resources for farmers, gardeners, and consumers about the benefits and uses of BioChar.

What is Biochar?
======
BioChar is a carbon-rich product that is created when biomass (such as wood, manure, or crop residues) is heated in a closed container with little or no available oxygen. In more technical terms, biochar is produced by thermal decomposition of organic material under limited supply of oxygen (O2), and at relatively low temperatures (<700Â°C).

This process, called pyrolysis, is different from the (typically high-temperature) burning and decomposition of organic material aboveground or in soils with plenty of oxygen (O2) present.

We support sustainable practices
======
By trapping carbon in the soil and thus preventing it from returning to the atmosphere, biochar can potentially play a significant role in mitigating anthropogenic climate change. Additionally, biochar improves the soil structure and provides habitat for many beneficial soil microbes.
